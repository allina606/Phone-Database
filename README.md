# Phone-Database
Used C++ to create a mini phone database. Using parallel arrays, quantity and price was assigned to each product under a unique product ID. Functions allow for user to update, add, and display product attributes. 

Some experimentation with pointers included: passing pointers by reference, pointer notation, and arrays as pointers.
